# Exploratory Data Analysis on Telco Customer Churn
##### [Posted on medium](https://medium.com/@roberdmanihuruk17/)


Standard exploratory data analysis with interpretations on telco customer churn.

The data used in this analysis is an open source dataset [WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv](https://github.com/roberdmanihuruk/education_income_hypothesis_testing/blob/main/marketing_campaign.csv) or can be found on this [link.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)



## Steps
1. Standard data cleansing ( Missing values & Duplicated values)
2. Standard EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
    - Statistical summary of columns
    - Univariate analysis
    - Multivariate analysis
3. Deep-dive exploration by asking questions about the data

## Conclusion
Telco Customer Churn data does not have major issues. There are only some empty values and no duplicated rows. From the EDA we can conclude customers who do not churn are relatively on the long tenure even though the total charge is higher, and the ustomers who use other services: Online Security, Online Backup, Device Protection, and Tech Suport are more unlikely to churn.

There is much more that can be explored from this data and of course can also use various methods to gain different insights.

Thank you :pray:
